ansi.js
=========
### Advanced ANSI formatting tool for Node.js

`ansi.js` is a module for Node.js that provides an easy-to-use API for
writing ANSI escape codes to `Stream` instances. ANSI escape codes are used to do
fancy things in a terminal window, like render text in colors, delete characters,
lines, the entire window, or hide and show the cursor, and lots more!

#### Features:

 * 256 color support for the terminal!
 * Make a beep sound from your terminal!
 * Works with *any* writable `Stream` instance.
 * Allows you to move the cursor anywhere on the terminal window.
 * Allows you to delete existing contents from the terminal window.
 * Allows you to hide and show the cursor.
 * Converts CSS color codes and RGB values into ANSI escape codes.
 * Low-level; you are in control of when escape codes are used, it's not abstracted.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install ansi
```


Example
-------

``` js
var ansi = require('ansi')
  , cursor = ansi(process.stdout)

// You can chain your calls forever:
cursor
  .red()                 // Set font color to red
  .bg.grey()             // Set background color to grey
  .write('Hello World!') // Write 'Hello World!' to stdout
  .bg.reset()            // Reset the bgcolor before writing the trailing \n,
                         //      to avoid Terminal glitches
  .write('\n')           // And a final \n to wrap things up

// Rendering modes are persistent:
cursor.hex('#660000').bold().underline()

// You can use the regular logging functions, text will be green:
console.log('This is blood red, bold text')

// To reset just the foreground color:
cursor.fg.reset()

console.log('This will still be bold')

// to go to a location (x,y) on the console
// note: 1-indexed, not 0-indexed:
cursor.goto(10, 5).write('Five down, ten over')

// to clear the current line:
cursor.horizontalAbsolute(0).eraseLine().write('Starting again')

// to go to a different column on the current line:
cursor.horizontalAbsolute(5).write('column five')

// Clean up after yourself!
cursor.reset()
```

# node-assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
	    assert.object(options, 'options');
		assert.number(options.id, 'options.id);
		assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
		assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
		assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
		assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
		callback(null, {});
    }

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
	at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
	at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
	at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
	at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
	at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
	at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
	at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
	at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

    function test(foo) {
	    assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

    function test(foo) {
	    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.arrayOfBool
* assert.arrayOfFunc
* assert.arrayOfNumber
* assert.arrayOfObject
* assert.arrayOfString
* assert.optionalBool
* assert.optionalBuffer
* assert.optionalFunc
* assert.optionalNumber
* assert.optionalObject
* assert.optionalString
* assert.optionalArrayOfBool
* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc
* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber
* assert.optionalArrayOfObject
* assert.optionalArrayOfString
* assert.AssertionError
* assert.fail
* assert.ok
* assert.equal
* assert.notEqual
* assert.deepEqual
* assert.notDeepEqual
* assert.strictEqual
* assert.notStrictEqual
* assert.throws
* assert.doesNotThrow
* assert.ifError

# Installation

    npm install assert-plus

# better-assert

  Better c-style assertions using [callsite](https://github.com/visionmedia/callsite) for
  self-documenting failure messages.

## Installation

    $ npm install better-assert

## Example

 By default assertions are enabled, however the __NO_ASSERT__ environment variable 
 will deactivate them when truthy.

```js
var assert = require('better-assert');

test();

function test() {
  var user = { name: 'tobi' };
  assert('tobi' == user.name);
  assert('number' == typeof user.age);
}

AssertionError: 'number' == typeof user.age
    at test (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:9:3)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/tj/projects/better-assert/example.js:4:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)

# Emitter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/component/emitter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/component/emitter)

  Event emitter component.

## Installation

```
$ component install component/emitter
```

## API

### Emitter(obj)

  The `Emitter` may also be used as a mixin. For example
  a "plain" object may become an emitter, or you may
  extend an existing prototype.

  As an `Emitter` instance:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
var emitter = new Emitter;
emitter.emit('something');
```

  As a mixin:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
var user = { name: 'tobi' };
Emitter(user);

user.emit('im a user');
```

  As a prototype mixin:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
Emitter(User.prototype);
```

### Emitter#on(event, fn)

  Register an `event` handler `fn`.

### Emitter#once(event, fn)

  Register a single-shot `event` handler `fn`,
  removed immediately after it is invoked the
  first time.

### Emitter#off(event, fn)

  * Pass `event` and `fn` to remove a listener.
  * Pass `event` to remove all listeners on that event.
  * Pass nothing to remove all listeners on all events.

### Emitter#emit(event, ...)

  Emit an `event` with variable option args.

### Emitter#listeners(event)

  Return an array of callbacks, or an empty array.

### Emitter#hasListeners(event)

  Check if this emitter has `event` handlers.

# node-dateformat

A node.js package for Steven Levithan's excellent [dateFormat()][dateformat] function.

## Modifications

* Removed the `Date.prototype.format` method. Sorry folks, but extending native prototypes is for suckers.
* Added a `module.exports = dateFormat;` statement at the bottom

## Usage

As taken from Steven's post, modified to match the Modifications listed above:

    var dateFormat = require('dateformat');
    var now = new Date();

    // Basic usage
    dateFormat(now, "dddd, mmmm dS, yyyy, h:MM:ss TT");
    // Saturday, June 9th, 2007, 5:46:21 PM

    // You can use one of several named masks
    dateFormat(now, "isoDateTime");
    // 2007-06-09T17:46:21

    // ...Or add your own
    dateFormat.masks.hammerTime = 'HH:MM! "Can\'t touch this!"';
    dateFormat(now, "hammerTime");
    // 17:46! Can't touch this!

    // When using the standalone dateFormat function,
    // you can also provide the date as a string
    dateFormat("Jun 9 2007", "fullDate");
    // Saturday, June 9, 2007

    // Note that if you don't include the mask argument,
    // dateFormat.masks.default is used
    dateFormat(now);
    // Sat Jun 09 2007 17:46:21

    // And if you don't include the date argument,
    // the current date and time is used
    dateFormat();
    // Sat Jun 09 2007 17:46:22

    // You can also skip the date argument (as long as your mask doesn't
    // contain any numbers), in which case the current date/time is used
    dateFormat("longTime");
    // 5:46:22 PM EST

    // And finally, you can convert local time to UTC time. Simply pass in
    // true as an additional argument (no argument skipping allowed in this case):
    dateFormat(now, "longTime", true);
    // 10:46:21 PM UTC

    // ...Or add the prefix "UTC:" to your mask.
    dateFormat(now, "UTC:h:MM:ss TT Z");
    // 10:46:21 PM UTC

    // You can also get the ISO 8601 week of the year:
    dateFormat(now, "W");
    // 42

Package: debug@0.7.4
Repository: https://github.com/visionmedia/debug

License Source: README
Source Text:

# debug

  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.

## Installation

```
$ npm install debug
```

## Usage

 With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.
 
Example _app.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('http')
  , http = require('http')
  , name = 'My App';

// fake app

debug('booting %s', name);

http.createServer(function(req, res){
  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);
  res.end('hello\n');
}).listen(3000, function(){
  debug('listening');
});

// fake worker of some kind

require('./worker');
```

Example _worker.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('worker');

setInterval(function(){
  debug('doing some work');
}, 1000);
```

 The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:

  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)

  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)

## Millisecond diff

  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.

  When stderr is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:
  _(NOTE: Debug now uses stderr instead of stdout, so the correct shell command for this example is actually `DEBUG=* node example/worker 2> out &`)_
  
  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)
  
## Conventions

 If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser". 

## Wildcards

  The "*" character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.

  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=* -connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".

## Browser support

 Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`. 

```js
a = debug('worker:a');
b = debug('worker:b');

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1000);

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1200);
```

# debug

  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core's debugging technique.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install debug
```

## Usage

 With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you're used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.

Example _app.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('http')
  , http = require('http')
  , name = 'My App';

// fake app

debug('booting %s', name);

http.createServer(function(req, res){
  debug(req.method + ' ' + req.url);
  res.end('hello\n');
}).listen(3000, function(){
  debug('listening');
});

// fake worker of some kind

require('./worker');
```

Example _worker.js_:

```js
var debug = require('debug')('worker');

setInterval(function(){
  debug('doing some work');
}, 1000);
```

 The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:

  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)

  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)

## Millisecond diff

  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.

  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)

  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:

  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)

## Conventions

 If you're using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".

Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.

  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".

## Browser support

  Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. For example if you have `worker:a` and `worker:b` as shown below, and wish to debug both type `debug.enable('worker:*')` in the console and refresh the page, this will remain until you disable with `debug.disable()`.

```js
a = debug('worker:a');
b = debug('worker:b');

setInterval(function(){
  a('doing some work');
}, 1000);

setInterval(function(){
  b('doing some work');
}, 1200);
```

#### Web Inspector Colors

  Colors are also enabled on "Web Inspectors" that understand the `%c` formatting
  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, and the Firebug plugin for Firefox.
  Colored output looks something like:

### stderr vs stdout

You can set an alternative logging method per-namespace by overriding the `log` method on a per-namespace or globally:

Example _stderr.js_:

```js
var debug = require('../');
var log = debug('app:log');

// by default console.log is used
log('goes to stdout!');

var error = debug('app:error');
// set this namespace to log via console.error
error.log = console.error.bind(console); // don't forget to bind to console!
error('goes to stderr');
log('still goes to stdout!');

// set all output to go via console.warn
// overrides all per-namespace log settings
debug.log = console.warn.bind(console);
log('now goes to stderr via console.warn');
error('still goes to stderr, but via console.warn now');
```

# Engine.IO client

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io-client.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io-client)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io-client.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io-client)

This is the client for [Engine.IO](http://github.com/automattic/engine.io),
the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device
bi-directional communication layer for [Socket.IO](http://github.com/automattic/socket.io).

## How to use

### Standalone

You can find an `engine.io.js` file in this repository, which is a
standalone build you can use as follows:

```html
<script src="/path/to/engine.io.js"></script>
<script>
  // eio = Socket
  var socket = eio('ws://localhost');
  socket.on('open', function(){
    socket.on('message', function(data){});
    socket.on('close', function(){});
  });
</script>
```

### With browserify

Engine.IO is a commonjs module, which means you can include it by using
`require` on the browser and package using [browserify](http://browserify.org/):

1. install the client package

    ```bash
    $ npm install engine.io-client
    ```

1. write your app code

    ```js
    var socket = require('engine.io-client')('ws://localhost');
    socket.on('open', function(){
      socket.on('message', function(data){});
      socket.on('close', function(){});
    });
    ```

1. build your app bundle

    ```bash
    $ browserify app.js > bundle.js
    ```

1. include on your page

    ```html
    <script src="/path/to/bundle.js"></script>
    ```

### Sending and receiving binary

```html
<script src="/path/to/engine.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = new eio.Socket('ws://localhost/');
  socket.binaryType = 'blob';
  socket.on('open', function () {
    socket.send(new Int8Array(5));
    socket.on('message', function(blob){});
    socket.on('close', function(){ });
  });
</script>
```

### Node.JS

Add `engine.io-client` to your `package.json` and then:

```js
var socket = require('engine.io-client')('ws://localhost');
socket.on('open', function(){
  socket.on('message', function(data){});
  socket.on('close', function(){});
});
```

### Node.js with certificates
```js
var opts = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/client.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/client.crt'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/ca.crt')
};

var socket = require('engine.io-client')('ws://localhost', opts);
socket.on('open', function(){
  socket.on('message', function(data){});
  socket.on('close', function(){});
});
```

## Features

- Lightweight
- Runs on browser and node.js seamlessly
- Transports are independent of `Engine`
  - Easy to debug
  - Easy to unit test
- Runs inside HTML5 WebWorker
- Can send and receive binary data
  - Receives as ArrayBuffer or Blob when in browser, and Buffer or ArrayBuffer
    in Node
  - When XHR2 or WebSockets are used, binary is emitted directly. Otherwise
    binary is encoded into base64 strings, and decoded when binary types are
    supported.
  - With browsers that don't support ArrayBuffer, an object { base64: true,
    data: dataAsBase64String } is emitted on the `message` event.

## API

### Socket

The client class. Mixes in [Emitter](http://github.com/component/emitter).
Exposed as `eio` in the browser standalone build.

#### Properties

- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number
- `binaryType` _(String)_ : can be set to 'arraybuffer' or 'blob' in browsers,
  and `buffer` or `arraybuffer` in Node. Blob is only used in browser if it's
  supported.

#### Events

- `open`
  - Fired upon successful connection.
- `message`
  - Fired when data is received from the server.
  - **Arguments**
    - `String` | `ArrayBuffer`: utf-8 encoded data or ArrayBuffer containing
      binary data
- `close`
  - Fired upon disconnection. In compliance with the WebSocket API spec, this event may be 
    fired even if the `open` event does not occur (i.e. due to connection error or `close()`).
- `error`
  - Fired when an error occurs.
- `flush`
  - Fired upon completing a buffer flush
- `drain`
  - Fired after `drain` event of transport if writeBuffer is empty
- `upgradeError`
  - Fired if an error occurs with a transport we're trying to upgrade to.
- `upgrade`
  - Fired upon upgrade success, after the new transport is set

#### Methods

- **constructor**
    - Initializes the client
    - **Parameters**
      - `String` uri
      - `Object`: optional, options object
    - **Options**
      - `agent` (`http.Agent`): `http.Agent` to use, defaults to `false` (NodeJS only)
      - `upgrade` (`Boolean`): defaults to true, whether the client should try
      to upgrade the transport from long-polling to something better.
      - `forceJSONP` (`Boolean`): forces JSONP for polling transport.
      - `jsonp` (`Boolean`): determines whether to use JSONP when
        necessary for polling. If disabled (by settings to false) an error will
        be emitted (saying "No transports available") if no other transports
        are available. If another transport is available for opening a
        connection (e.g. WebSocket) that transport
        will be used instead.
      - `forceBase64` (`Boolean`): forces base 64 encoding for polling transport even when XHR2 responseType is available and WebSocket even if the used standard supports binary.
      - `enablesXDR` (`Boolean`): enables XDomainRequest for IE8 to avoid loading bar flashing with click sound. default to `false` because XDomainRequest has a flaw of not sending cookie.
      - `timestampRequests` (`Boolean`): whether to add the timestamp with
        each transport request. Note: this is ignored if the browser is
        IE or Android, in which case requests are always stamped (`false`)
      - `timestampParam` (`String`): timestamp parameter (`t`)
      - `policyPort` (`Number`): port the policy server listens on (`843`)
      - `path` (`String`): path to connect to, default is `/engine.io`
      - `transports` (`Array`): a list of transports to try (in order).
      Defaults to `['polling', 'websocket']`. `Engine`
      always attempts to connect directly with the first one, provided the
      feature detection test for it passes.
      - `rememberUpgrade` (`Boolean`): defaults to false.
        If true and if the previous websocket connection to the server succeeded,
        the connection attempt will bypass the normal upgrade process and will initially
        try websocket. A connection attempt following a transport error will use the 
        normal upgrade process. It is recommended you turn this on only when using
        SSL/TLS connections, or if you know that your network does not block websockets.
      - `pfx` (`String`): Certificate, Private key and CA certificates to use for SSL. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
      - `key` (`String`): Private key to use for SSL. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
      - `passphrase` (`String`): A string of passphrase for the private key or pfx. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
      - `cert` (`String`): Public x509 certificate to use. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
      - `ca` (`String`|`Array`): An authority certificate or array of authority certificates to check the remote host against.. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
      - `ciphers` (`String`): A string describing the ciphers to use or exclude. Consult the [cipher format list](http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_LIST_FORMAT) for details on the format.. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
      - `rejectUnauthorized` (`Boolean`): If true, the server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs. An 'error' event is emitted if verification fails. Verification happens at the connection level, before the HTTP request is sent. Can be used in Node.js client environment to manually specify certificate information.
- `send`
    - Sends a message to the server
    - **Parameters**
      - `String` | `ArrayBuffer` | `ArrayBufferView` | `Blob`: data to send
      - `Function`: optional, callback upon `drain`
- `close`
    - Disconnects the client.

### Transport

The transport class. Private. _Inherits from EventEmitter_.

#### Events

- `poll`: emitted by polling transports upon starting a new request
- `pollComplete`: emitted by polling transports upon completing a request
- `drain`: emitted by polling transports upon a buffer drain

## Tests

`engine.io-client` is used to test
[engine](http://github.com/automattic/engine.io). Running the `engine.io`
test suite ensures the client works and vice-versa.

Browser tests are run using [zuul](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul). You can
run the tests locally using the following command.

```
./node_modules/.bin/zuul --local 8080 -- test/index.js
```

Additionally, `engine.io-client` has a standalone test suite you can run
with `make test` which will run node.js and browser tests. You must have zuul setup with
a saucelabs account.

## Support

The support channels for `engine.io-client` are the same as `socket.io`:
  - irc.freenode.net **#socket.io**
  - [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/socket_io)
  - [Website](http://socket.io)

## Development

To contribute patches, run tests or benchmarks, make sure to clone the
repository:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/automattic/engine.io-client.git
```

Then:

```bash
cd engine.io-client
npm install
```

See the `Tests` section above for how to run tests before submitting any patches.

# Engine.IO: the realtime engine

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/engine.io)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/engine.io)

`Engine.IO` is the implementation of transport-based
cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for
[Socket.IO](http://github.com/learnboost/socket.io).

## How to use

### Server

#### (A) Listening on a port

```js
var engine = require('engine.io');
var server = engine.listen(80);

server.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.send('utf 8 string');
  socket.send(new Buffer([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // binary data
});
```

#### (B) Intercepting requests for a http.Server

```js
var engine = require('engine.io');
var http = require('http').createServer().listen(3000);
var server = engine.attach(http);

server.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.on('message', function(data){ });
  socket.on('close', function(){ });
});
```

#### (C) Passing in requests

```js
var engine = require('engine.io');
var server = new engine.Server();

server.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.send('hi');
});

// …
httpServer.on('upgrade', function(req, socket, head){
  server.handleUpgrade(req, socket, head);
});
httpServer.on('request', function(req, res){
  server.handleRequest(req, res);
});
```

### Client

```html
<script src="/path/to/engine.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = new eio.Socket('ws://localhost/');
  socket.on('open', function(){
    socket.on('message', function(data){});
    socket.on('close', function(){});
  });
</script>
```

For more information on the client refer to the
[engine-client](http://github.com/learnboost/engine.io-client) repository.

## What features does it have?

- **Maximum reliability**. Connections are established even in the presence of:
  - proxies and load balancers.
  - personal firewall and antivirus software.
  - for more information refer to **Goals** and **Architecture** sections
- **Minimal client size** aided by:
  - lazy loading of flash transports.
  - lack of redundant transports.
- **Scalable**
  - load balancer friendly
- **Future proof**

## API

### Server

<hr><br>

#### Top-level

These are exposed by `require('engine.io')`:

##### Events

- `flush`
    - Called when a socket buffer is being flushed.
    - **Arguments**
      - `Socket`: socket being flushed
      - `Array`: write buffer
- `drain`
    - Called when a socket buffer is drained
    - **Arguments**
      - `Socket`: socket being flushed

##### Properties

- `protocol` _(Number)_: protocol revision number
- `Server`: Server class constructor
- `Socket`: Socket class constructor
- `Transport` _(Function)_: transport constructor
- `transports` _(Object)_: map of available transports

##### Methods

- `()`
    - Returns a new `Server` instance. If the first argument is an `http.Server` then the
      new `Server` instance will be attached to it. Otherwise, the arguments are passed
      directly to the `Server` constructor.
    - **Parameters**
      - `http.Server`: optional, server to attach to.
      - `Object`: optional, options object (see `Server#constructor` api docs below)

  The following are identical ways to instantiate a server and then attach it.
  ```js
  var httpServer; // previously created with `http.createServer();` from node.js api.

  // create a server first, and then attach
  var eioServer = require('engine.io').Server();
  eioServer.attach(httpServer);

  // or call the module as a function to get `Server`
  var eioServer = require('engine.io')();
  eioServer.attach(httpServer);

  // immediately attach
  var eioServer = require('engine.io')(httpServer);
  ```

- `listen`
    - Creates an `http.Server` which listens on the given port and attaches WS
      to it. It returns `501 Not Implemented` for regular http requests.
    - **Parameters**
      - `Number`: port to listen on.
      - `Object`: optional, options object
      - `Function`: callback for `listen`.
    - **Options**
      - All options from `Server.attach` method, documented below.
      - **Additionally** See Server `constructor` below for options you can pass for creating the new Server
    - **Returns** `Server`
- `attach`
    - Captures `upgrade` requests for a `http.Server`. In other words, makes
      a regular http.Server WebSocket-compatible.
    - **Parameters**
      - `http.Server`: server to attach to.
      - `Object`: optional, options object
    - **Options**
      - All options from `Server.attach` method, documented below.
      - **Additionally** See Server `constructor` below for options you can pass for creating the new Server
    - **Returns** `Server` a new Server instance.

### Client

<hr><br>

Exposed in the `eio` global namespace (in the browser), or by
`require('engine.io-client')` (in Node.JS).

For the client API refer to the 
[engine-client](http://github.com/learnboost/engine.io-client) repository.

## Debug / logging

Engine.IO is powered by [debug](http://github.com/visionmedia/debug).
In order to see all the debug output, run your app with the environment variable
`DEBUG` including the desired scope.

To see the output from all of Engine.IO's debugging scopes you can use:

```
DEBUG=engine* node myapp
```

## Transports

- `polling`: XHR / JSONP polling transport.
- `websocket`: WebSocket transport.

## Plugins

- [engine.io-conflation](https://github.com/EugenDueck/engine.io-conflation): Makes **conflation and aggregation** of messages straightforward.

## Support

The support channels for `engine.io` are the same as `socket.io`:
  - irc.freenode.net **#socket.io**
  - [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/socket_io)
  - [Website](http://socket.io)

## Development

To contribute patches, run tests or benchmarks, make sure to clone the
repository:

```
git clone git://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io.git
```

Then:

```
cd engine.io
npm install
```

## Tests

Tests run with `make test`. It runs the server tests that are aided by
the usage of `engine.io-client`.

Make sure `npm install` is run first.

## Goals

The main goal of `Engine` is ensuring the most reliable realtime communication.
Unlike the previous Socket.IO core, it always establishes a long-polling
connection first, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are "tested" on
the side.

During the lifetime of the Socket.IO projects, we've found countless drawbacks
to relying on `HTML5 WebSocket` or `Flash Socket` as the first connection
mechanisms.

Both are clearly the _right way_ of establishing a bidirectional communication,
with HTML5 WebSocket being the way of the future. However, to answer most business
needs, alternative traditional HTTP 1.1 mechanisms are just as good as delivering
the same solution.

WebSocket based connections have two fundamental benefits:

1. **Better server performance**
  - _A: Load balancers_<br>
      Load balancing a long polling connection poses a serious architectural nightmare
      since requests can come from any number of open sockets by the user agent, but
      they all need to be routed to the process and computer that owns the `Engine`
      connection. This negatively impacts RAM and CPU usage.
  - _B: Network traffic_<br>
      WebSocket is designed around the premise that each message frame has to be 
      surrounded by the least amount of data. In HTTP 1.1 transports, each message
      frame is surrounded by HTTP headers and chunked encoding frames. If you try to
      send the message _"Hello world"_ with xhr-polling, the message ultimately
      becomes larger than if you were to send it with WebSocket.
  - _C: Lightweight parser_<br>
      As an effect of **B**, the server has to do a lot more work to parse the network
      data and figure out the message when traditional HTTP requests are used
      (as in long polling). This means that another advantage of WebSocket is
      less server CPU usage.

2. **Better user experience**

    Due to the reasons stated in point **1**, the most important effect of being able
    to establish a WebSocket connection is raw data transfer speed, which translates
    in _some_ cases in better user experience.

    Applications with heavy realtime interaction (such as games) will benefit greatly,
    whereas applications like realtime chat (Gmail/Facebook), newsfeeds (Facebook) or
    timelines (Twitter) will have negligible user experience improvements.

Having said this, attempting to establish a WebSocket connection directly so far has
proven problematic:

1. **Proxies**<br>
    Many corporate proxies block WebSocket traffic.

2. **Personal firewall and antivirus software**<br>
    As a result of our research, we've found that at least 3 personal security
    applications block WebSocket traffic.

3. **Cloud application platforms**<br>
    Platforms like Heroku or No.de have had trouble keeping up with the fast-paced
    nature of the evolution of the WebSocket protocol. Applications therefore end up
    inevitably using long polling, but the seamless installation experience of 
    Socket.IO we strive for (_"require() it and it just works"_) disappears.

Some of these problems have solutions. In the case of proxies and personal programs,
however, the solutions many times involve upgrading software. Experience has shown
that relying on client software upgrades to deliver a business solution is
fruitless: the very existence of this project has to do with a fragmented panorama
of user agent distribution, with clients connecting with latest versions of the most
modern user agents (Chrome, Firefox and Safari), but others with versions as low as
IE 5.5.

From the user perspective, an unsuccessful WebSocket connection can translate in
up to at least 10 seconds of waiting for the realtime application to begin
exchanging data. This **perceptively** hurts user experience.

To summarize, **Engine** focuses on reliability and user experience first, marginal
potential UX improvements and increased server performance second. `Engine` is the
result of all the lessons learned with WebSocket in the wild.

## Architecture

The main premise of `Engine`, and the core of its existence, is the ability to
swap transports on the fly. A connection starts as xhr-polling, but it can
switch to WebSocket.

The central problem this poses is: how do we switch transports without losing
messages?

`Engine` only switches from polling to another transport in between polling
cycles. Since the server closes the connection after a certain timeout when
there's no activity, and the polling transport implementation buffers messages
in between connections, this ensures no message loss and optimal performance.

Another benefit of this design is that we workaround almost all the limitations
of **Flash Socket**, such as slow connection times, increased file size (we can
safely lazy load it without hurting user experience), etc.

## FAQ

### Can I use engine without Socket.IO ?

Absolutely. Although the recommended framework for building realtime applications
is Socket.IO, since it provides fundamental features for real-world applications 
such as multiplexing, reconnection support, etc.

`Engine` is to Socket.IO what Connect is to Express. An essential piece for building
realtime frameworks, but something you _probably_ won't be using for building
actual applications.

### Does the server serve the client?

No. The main reason is that `Engine` is meant to be bundled with frameworks.
Socket.IO includes `Engine`, therefore serving two clients is not necessary. If
you use Socket.IO, including

```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js">
```

has you covered.

### Can I implement `Engine` in other languages?

Absolutely. The [engine.io-protocol](https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol)
repository contains the most up to date description of the specification
at all times, and the parser implementation in JavaScript.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ms.js: miliseconds conversion utility

```js
ms('1d')      // 86400000
ms('10h')     // 36000000
ms('2h')      // 7200000
ms('1m')      // 60000
ms('5s')      // 5000
ms('100')     // 100
```

```js
ms(60000)             // "1m"
ms(2 * 60000)         // "2m"
ms(ms('10 hours'))    // "10h"
```

```js
ms(60000, { long: true })             // "1 minute"
ms(2 * 60000, { long: true })         // "2 minutes"
ms(ms('10 hours', { long: true }))    // "10 hours"
```

- Node/Browser compatible. Published as `ms` in NPM.
- If a number is supplied to `ms`, a string with a unit is returned.
- If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it as
a number (e.g: it returns `100` for `'100'`).
- If you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, the number of
equivalent ms is returned.

   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) 
beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising 
permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, 
and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not 
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object 
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright 
notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is 
provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original 
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor 
for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or 
Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For 
the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of 
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its 
representatives, including but not limited to communication on 
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue 
tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for 
the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding 
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in 
writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on 
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright 
license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such 
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in 
this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, 
sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license 
applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that 
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such 
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within 
the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then 
any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work 
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work 
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the 
following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a 
copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices 
from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not 
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include 
a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE 
file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a 
NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the 
NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE 
text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may 
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such 
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and 
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated 
in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by 
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this 
License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the 
above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding 
such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed 
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides 
its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS 
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, 
any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely 
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or 
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your 
exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless 
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You 
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but 
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of 
such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the 
Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a 
fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability 
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in 
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on 
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and 
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.
